# Short contributing guide for NetMonsterUKDatabase

* Try and import your data in cell ID order, it makes it easier to navigate (5G SA can go at the bottom atm)
* For sites that may have two slightly different locations on different operators, mark what networks they are on like this: [Cornerstone] for Vodafone/O2 in one location, [MBNL] for EE/3 in one location or just use [Network Name] if it's single operator
* Please use a descriptive name, something like "M32, Bristol, UK" is very generic and it doesn't really pinpoint where the site is actually located unless you look at the map. Try and include the county name (if applicable, in this example, it would not be) and district if possible.
