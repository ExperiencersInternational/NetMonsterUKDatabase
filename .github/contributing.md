# Short contributing guide for NetMonsterUKDatabase

* Try and import your data in cell ID order, it makes it easier to navigate (5G SA can go at the bottom atm) (**note:** if you do not want to do this but still have data you want to share, please file an issue and I can sort it out)
* Naming sites are not required (if you don't want to name a site, just put `-` in the field for names), but it is appreciated. If you are going to name it, it is appreciated if you can use a descriptive enough name (e.g. instead of "M5, Banwell, UK" do something like "M5 South, Woolvershill Batch, North Somerset, England, UK")
* If a site is close to another site but a different operator broadcasts on the other site, it is recommended that you label what networks are on the site (e.g. [Cornerstone] for Vodafone/O2 in that location, [MBNL] for EE/3 or [Network Name] for single operator)
