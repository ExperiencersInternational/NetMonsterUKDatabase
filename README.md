# NetMonsterUKDatabase

A NetMonster database of sites across a limited area in the UK. Initial split files were split using Python code that was written by Copilot AI (bring the tomatoes out, yeah I know it's bad), but the combined file has not been tampered with by AI whatsoever and is the same data from my local database.
