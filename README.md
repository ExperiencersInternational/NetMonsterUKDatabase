# NetMonsterUKDatabase

A NetMonster database of sites across a limited area in the UK. I did initially have split files here (which were split through AI code), but I have ultimately decided not to have them now just since it makes things easier for me until this gets contributors. I'll likely only publish a new big release every so often?

Please note that some entries on the list are for networks abroad.

Import onto your device by opening the NetMonster app > Menu > Database > Import > Pick File with the combined NTM downloaded from the releases page.

## Supported areas

These areas should have at least 10% coverage on at least one operator on 4G. This will probably get added to in the future. Some of these areas may be limited to something as simple as sites along a major road or railway, so this does not guarantee that you will have any data in your specific area.
