# NetMonsterUKDatabase

A NetMonster database of sites across a limited area in the UK. I did initially have split files here (which were split through AI code), but I have ultimately decided not to have them now just since it makes things easier for me until this gets contributors. I'll likely only publish a new big release every so often?

Please note that some entries on the list are for networks abroad.

Import onto your device by opening the NetMonster app > Menu > Database > Import > Pick File with the combined NTM downloaded from the releases page.
